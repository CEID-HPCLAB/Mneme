'''
This file contains utility functions for handling OneHotEncoder objects in a machine learning pipeline. 
It includes functions for reducing a list of partially fitted OneHotEncoders into a single OneHotEncoder. 
These functions are designed to streamline the process of working with OneHotEncoder instances, 
particularly in scenarios where data preprocessing steps are distributed or parallelized.

def _copy_attr(target_obj, source_obj: OneHotEncoder) -> None:
    '''
    Copies attributes from a source OneHotEncoder object to a target object.

    This function iterates over all attributes of the source object and sets the same attribute for the target object.

    Args:
        target_obj (object): The object to which attributes will be copied.
        source_obj (OneHotEncoder): The OneHotEncoder object from which attributes will be copied.

    Returns:
